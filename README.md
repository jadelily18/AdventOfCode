# Advent of Code 2023

My AoC solutions, written in Rust 1.74!

These solutions use [Advent of Code Downloader](https://github.com/GreenLightning/advent-of-code-downloader)
for downloading input files. Install and set up your session cookie and run the following to generate an
input file for a specified day.

```shell
aocdl -day [DAY] -output ./[DAY_DIR]/input.txt
aocdl -output ./[DAY_DIR]/input.txt # or this for the current day
```
